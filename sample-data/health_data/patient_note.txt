Mr. Cormier is a previously healthy 56-year-old gentleman who presents with a four day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and right-sided chest pain. He works as a truck driver, and the symptoms began four days prior to admission, while he was in Jackson, MS. He drove from Jackson to Abilene, TX, the day after the symptoms began, where worsening of his dyspnea and pain prompted him to go to the emergency room.
