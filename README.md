## Create a Virtual Python Environment:
By following these steps, you can create a requirements.txt file and use it to install the necessary packages in your virtual environment. This approach ensures that all required dependencies are managed efficiently.

Step 1: Create a virtual environment  
`python -m venv myenv`
  
Step 2: Activate the virtual environment  
On macOS/Linux  
`source myenv/bin/activate`

On Windows  
`myenv\Scripts\activate` 
  
Step 3: Install required packages using requirements.txt  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  
Step 4: Verify installation  
`pip list`  
  
Step 5: Deactivate the virtual environment when done  
`deactivate`
